# REST-APIs-with-Flask-and-Python
Code from Section 6 and onwards of the REST APIs with Flask and Python course on Udemy. Section 10 code is excluded as it requires the purchase of a domain name.

The master branch is deployed on Heroku.

The code from [Section6/Local](https://github.com/bronson-c/REST-APIs-with-Flask-and-Python/tree/Section6/Local) and [section11/JWT-extended](https://github.com/bronson-c/REST-APIs-with-Flask-and-Python/tree/section11/JWT-extended) can be run locally for testing purposes. Section 11's code introduces functionality made possible by flask-jwt-extended.

The code from [Section9/DigitalOceanServer](https://github.com/bronson-c/REST-APIs-with-Flask-and-Python/tree/Section9/DigitalOceanServer) runs via a DigitalOcean Droplet.
